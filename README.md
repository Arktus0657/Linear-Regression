# Linear-Regression
 This is a linear Regression repository. This involves building a linear regression library from scratch. And then adding all the feature required by the linear regression model from scratch. Along with the library, this will also contain multiple linear regression models that will be trained and tested using my personally developed model as well as the prebuilt models of python.


## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `python src/model.py`
